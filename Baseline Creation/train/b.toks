say this about @realdonaldtrump , he knows a lost cause when he sees it .
i hear that people are concerned that hillarys going to be #president .
trump is running his campaign like his " charity he cons others into donating by pretending to donate his own money
i think people are done giving . its too late .
trump's given no cash to his campaign in last 3 weeks . he's counting on the suckers to keep donating
poor small donor sheeple ! #donthecon has lost big donors himself who gave zero to his campaign lately h
looks like even trump has given up he gave no cash & amp ; just $31k worth of rent & amp ; salaries to his campaign in oct
republican contributors shifted their focus to house and senate races, filings showed, and mr. trump gave no cash to his campaign in the first three weeks of october.

trump said women get abortions days before birth . docs say they dont . he lives in fictional reality ht
a fact generally isn't something completely made up .

hacked emails from @wikileaks show @chelseaclinton to be a champion against corruption .
frustrations , devotion shown in hacked emails if they're real .
in light of today's events , it's so comforting to read " clinton , who does not use email " .
nyt thinks it ok to report the contents of documents stolen by russia and leaked by wikileaks

tell us your thoughts ! should the irs be able to penalize people for not having health insurance ?
if you make the penalties tougher , you need to make financial assistance broader and deeper .
young and healthy people choose the lesser cost . have you thought about genetic disorders and accidents
for millions , paying penalty for not having coverage is cheaper than the insurance itself
healthy millennials will pay more to the government and still have no health care !
affordable care act tax penalty is toothless
has the tax penalty been large enough to motivate people to sign up for health insurance ?
exactly what cj roberts relied on to uphold obamacare under taxing power that many would opt to pay the tax penalty
a lot of healthy people are defying predictions by the affordable care act architects and refusing to enroll, throwing off the math behind the system.

atlanta has brilliant characters . and some of the best acting on tv . by wesley morris via nyt arts
hey @wesley_morris your review of @atlantafx is incredible !
atlanta walks a line between magic realism and keeping it real

the men feminists left behind thanks 4 this @jillfilipovic but y no mention of @bellhooks #thewilltochange ?
while feminism has transformed american culture . the lives of women , men havent evolved nearly as rapidly .
hillary started yale law in 1969 , only one woman in the us senate and legal for a man to rape his wife .
this is part of the work ahead after november 8 . the divides and misperceptions run deep in this country .
expanding roles and opportunities for women cannot usher in full gender equality unless men change .

this is great work . stunning rebuke of liberal talking point .
these liberals explain how requiring id to vote is racist , then black people respond to their ridiculous claims .
what happens when you ask white berkeley liberals & amp ; black people in harlem about anti-voter id arguments

this is what we're saying that to assume that being a minority means you're too ill informed or ignorant to .
but it's no surprise since they're racists .
so then , which party is honest about the racist issue , that is propagated by some so loosely to get their way
if you haven't seen this yet , you must see how typical white liberal student views blacks and how blacks respond !
shows how liberalism is based on a perception of incapability in others , especially black people

2016 is horrible . gwen ifill just passed away
now the great gwen ifill of " pbs news hour " is dead . 2016 is proving itself one of the lousiest years ever

gwen ifill dead at 61 the daily beast
this week continues to get worse and worse . it's gotta get better , don't you think ?
yet more sad news during a rash of it the passing , far too soon , of top broadcast journalist gwen ifill . dead at 61
the long-time pbs reporter and anchor battled cancer for roughly a year, the daily beast has learned.
to explain the importance of peer review in the scientific process , especially given what passes for news today
then it's an amazing coincidence . call me when cops start killing unarmed white people .
can you believe the nerve of this organization ?
it's never been about what's true but what can be used to create a narrative that the left can exploit .
white cops don't unfairly target black suspects , study says
it's all in your heads , trouble is there is no intelligence in your head to realize this !

what donald trumps vow to deport up to 3 million immigrants would mean
it's not clear trump could deport up to 3m immigrants with criminal records quickly without violating due process
s vow to deport up to 3 million immigrants would mean massive raids on a nightmarish police state scale
even that number is woefully inaccurate and meaningless .
deporting 3 million would require one 747 taking off every hour for a year , and then .
featuring kevin appleby , cms senior director of international migration policy
by placing the number that high, the president-elect raised questions about which immigrants he planned to target and how he could achieve removals at that scale.

nice piece highlighting complexity of #sleep in #kids night owls may face special challenges
is your child a night owl ? they might face some issues later in life
are your kids getting enought #sleep ?
are you or one of your kids a " night owl " ? you might face some unique health risks .
in case you haven't heard . getting enough sleep is important , especially for kids !
as a night owl i find this very interesting . night owls may face special challenges
much more important for a childs emotional and behavioral well-being .
what's more important than #kids getting enough sleep ?
our internal clocks are varied, and a child may be expected to perform in school at the least alert times of day.
trump campaigned against lobbyists , but now theyre on his transition team
this can't be right . with so many lobbyist who's going to protect the average joe ?
the sheer speed of trump dumping campaign promises to hand us federal govt to corporate interests is breathtaking .
would believe the new york times ?
i guess it will take a team of lobbyists to " draing the swamp in washington .
hey #trump holes . more proof you fell for the okee doke
no doubt the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer .
getting better all the the time isn't it . any day again american is going to be as great as it was when bush was .
to critics of donald j. trump, the inclusion of lobbyists and other advisers with industry ties is a sign that he may not follow through on all of his promises.

on top of everything else , drumpf is a terrible neighbor
as the president-elect held meetings, down below it was a snarl of barricades, police officers, lead-footed tourists and aggrieved new yorkers.
according to trump's aides , he wants to continue to hold large rallies even after being elected .
he just wanted the title , he never wanted to do the job .
it seems more and more like trump does not want to be president , but just be treated like the president
donald trump prepares for white house move , but his tower may still beckon
shocked he won * wants to keep doing rallies * wants to keep staying at his house
all presidents have lived in the white house as part of the job . if you don't want to- he should give up the post .
aka trump want to be called ' president ' , but not be president
president trump's white power rallies will surely come with demonstrations of military force
one of the only things bringing me joy right is how much trump is going to haaaaaaate his new job .
as mr. trump prepares to assume the presidency, an open question remains about the capital he spurned: just how much is he willing to become a part of it?

autocracy: rules for survival
however well-intentioned, talk presuming trump'#039;s good faith assumes that he is prepared to find common ground with his many opponents, respect the institutions of government, and repudiate almost everything he has stood for during the campaign. in short, it is treating him as a normal politician. there has until now been little evidence that he can be one. it might be worth considering the rules i've learned for surviving in an autocracy and salvaging your sanity and self-respect.

ny times finally admits women voted along party lines , not gender
for years , political science has shown that party outweighs gender when it comes to voting .
70% voters said they thought tump's behavior toward women was problem , but 30% who said that voted for him anyway
as @clairecm points out very adroitly , women voted in similar patterns to previous cycles , along party lines
why women did not unite to vote against or hear @susansarandon explaining it
the results show how deep party affiliation runs , even in the most atypical of elections .
why physical objects did not unite to vote against donald substance
we have this expectation from living in the world that sex really matters . it does not change things at all .
party has long outweighed gender when people vote. this election turned out to be no different.

unlike previoous elections national polls were closer than statewide .
national polls missed the result by only a few points, but state polling systematically underestimated donald j. trumps standing in the upper midwest and northeast.

this from my colleague @dleonhardt suggests near-total vindication for everything @seantrende wrote after 2012
for every voter who voted obama in 12 & amp ; trump in 16 , at least 5 voted for trump after not voting 4 years ago ht
that pattern , obviously , cannot be explained by vote-switching among the white working class .
yougov-based analysis of us election it was the turnout gap , just not the one we were expecting
seems that in five key states that switched to trump , rep turnout rose while dems ' fell .
for every 1 voter who switched from obama to trump , at least 5 voted for trump after not having voted 4 years ago
so the supposed obama-to-trump flips were pretty minor compared to a 2016 surge in white 2012 non-voters .
trump has won the non-voters more than he convinced former democrats
turnout did not plummet this year, as some argued. but it did change.

these anti-trump protests play into the worst stereotypes of liberals as being brats who go to pieces when they .

those clamoring for facebook to fix its fake news problem should be careful what they wish for .

donald trumps far-flung holdings raise potential for conflicts of interest
unless deals with this properly there will just be a steady trickle of these conflict-of-interest stories .
as president , the american public expects that @realdonaldtrump will be held to a higher standard .
no president in modern times will have as many potential business conflicts of interest as trump
the start of what needs to be multiple stories trumps far-flung holdings raise potential for conflicts of interest
is the 24-hr feed of protests on the news cycle , and the incessant commentary distracting you from other things ?
will trump's foreign investments violate united states constitution ? prominent dc ethics lawyers raise the question .
it was essential to elect trump to prevent the corrupt , unethical clinton from getting in .
the conflicts are in many ways as complex as his business empire, adding a heightened degree of difficulty for mr. trump to separate his official duties from his private business affairs.
