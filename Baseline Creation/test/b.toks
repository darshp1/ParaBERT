are you paying attention to where your ads appear ? case in point @jetsuite appears on brietbart .
how to destroy the business model of rascist websites the role cies & amp ; marketers play
if i didn't read @breitbartnews , i wouldn't have seen this article in @nytimes . what a conundrum .

many companies dont know that their ads are appearing next to abhorrent content. tell them.
it takes an average of 12 years to recoup the cost of getting a ba degree , according to a new college board report .
if you're debating the value of your college degree , rest assured it will likely be worth the cost
i'm 41 and my degree has yet to pay off . but i still have hope .
i really love statistics , though . delightful way to ruin stupid people's lives .
this article paints it acceptable to pay off student loan in 10 years is ok .
of course cnn misses the bigger point . why has the cost of college skyrocketed over the past few years ?
i think this is a good thing ? average college degree pays off by age 34
college degrees pay off in the long run .
college degrees pays itself off by age 34 !
yes, college is still worth the cost. those with bachelor degrees earn more over their lifetime than high school graduates.

this great piece by @sangernyt is a must read . the detection and reaction to russian cyber ops were just too slow

any thoughts on if he can pull this off ? were going to have insurance for everybody .
the people and the media must hold the president to his word !
mr. trump provided no details about how his plan would work or what it would cost .
the president-elect said he was nearly ready to unveil his proposal, though he offered no details about how it would work or how much it would cost.
just so we understand the motivation behind the aca repeal .
obamacare repeal will hand a nauseating tax cut to the rich
this is simply disgraceful . the 400 richest americans will get tax cuts equal to obamacare subsidies in 20 states .
no replacement is probably what happens .

only three species outlive their fertility humans , killer whales and short-finned pilot whales .

amazon announced thursday that it plans to hire 100,000 new employees in the next 18 months . sounds like good .
amazon to add 100,000 jobs as retail crumbles we're headed to a jobless future
automation adds to bleak future for us retail if not for online shops , there would be 1.2 million more retail jobs .
the typical online retailer generates $ 1,267,000 in sales per employee vs $ 279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores .
online #retailers create jobs , but not as quickly as they are lost , and different ones .
good bye malls and department stores . i never really liked you anyway .
the announcement by the online giant reflects what an economist sees as an inevitable process in which new industries rise and replace old ones.
